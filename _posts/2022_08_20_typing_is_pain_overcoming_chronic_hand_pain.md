It could have beeen a laptop or desktop keyboard. The mouse, too. Even an ergonomic or horizontal mouse. Despite my initial reluctance, I eventually tried a keyboard tray with an adjustable height. At some point, it didn’t matter what the tool was: so long as it involved some variation of a physical keyboard and mouse, I would experience pain. Later on, this would apply to my phone use as well.

This problem started sometime after summer of 2018. During that summer I built my first gaming PC. By the time September rolled around, I was experiencing mild pain while playing games. But I soon learned it wasn’t just when playing games: it would come back even after using the computer for a few minutes. Typing essays and doing homework became even more painful. I switched to and from my PC and my MacBook to figure out if there was a setup that wouldn’t cause pain. Unfortunately, I struggled with pain for over a year and a half before I found a solution.

What took so long? Well, the pain was inconsistent: some days were better than others. Then, I graduated in 2019 and started working full time as a software engineer. Initially, the pain came on seldomly and was mild enough to ignore or control with breaks, if it was present at all. But gradually the pain became worse, more consistent and harder to ignore. I could no longer hide it and it was quite disruptive to my work and hobbies.

I had already seen two doctors about the pain and had an ERG study by this point. They didn’t think I had carpal tunnel or arthritis; nothing looked abnormal. The doctors expected ergonomics to be the main culprit. It was a relief to discover this wasn't a medical issue, but it wasn't helpful in solving the problem. While I spent a few weeks trying to get an ergonomic study at work (we love beuacracy), I tried to reinforce basic ergonomic principles on myself: feet firmly on the ground, back straight, arms at a 90 degree angle. Sometimes, I would also use wrist braces; these would allow me to work a little longer, but wouldn't completely prevent pain from distracting me.

When I eventually saw the ergonomist, she recommended a new chair, keyboard, mouse, and raising my monitors. She also encouraged regular breaks throughout the day so I could let my hands rest for a few minutes. These adjustments lead to a slight improvement initially, but the pain was still present: not bad enough to prevent me from getting work done, but enough to cause concern.
Then, in spring of 2021, my hands gave out completely. The pain became too much to bear and I just couldn't work. I used short term disability leave and started to see an occupational hand therapist. At some points, the pain was so bad that using my phone was painful. Swiping on the screen, typing too much, or holding it for too long became unbearable.
After a few months of hand therapy, I was able to manage the pain myself through breaks and stretching exercises. Today, over a year later, I keep that up with stretching occasionally and routine breaks, along with a daily warmup for my hands before I start work on the computer. This consists of a ring grip exerciser and resistance band for fingers ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G824Z3V/)).

Ever since Spring 2021, I have been warning my peers about how poor ergonomics could lead to pain and encouraged them to take regular breaks and develop a regular strecthing regimine. Additionally, I've compiled some tips I've learned along the way below. 

# Hands
* Avoid resting hands on keyboard, lap, or wrist rest (this could compress the ulnar or median nerves)
* Avoid resting arms on arm rests (this can compress the ulnar nerve)
* Fingers/hands should float above keyboard while typing
* Wrists should be below elbows while typing (prevents nerve compression)
* Do not strain your hand across the keyboard when doing keyboard shortcuts (use your other hand)
* Take breaks (this means no phones): Motion is lotion, keep moving, don’t stay in one position for long - 10/20 min for blood to circulate; can try 1 min of full body movement; or go for a walk
* Use your arm/shoulder to move mouse, not your wrist. For this same reason, don’t use the trackpad on your laptop.
* Numbness/tingling: Usually a worse sign than pain. Do nerve glides/stretches. Consider seeing a doctor.
* Sleeping with arms folded (like hugging a teddy bear) can compress nerves. Beware of any tingling/numbness in hands from sleeping.
* When holding a phone in your hand, do not use your pinky to support it from the bottom (stresses ulnar nerve)

# Eyes
* 20/20/20 rule: Look 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes to relax the muscles in your eyes
* Try Blue Light Glasses if that doesn't help. Make sure to mention it to your eye doctor at your yearly eye exam (also very important if you're staring at screens all day, which is practically everyone)

# Keyboards and Mouse
* Your mileage may vary, but I've had the best luck with the [Kinesis Freestyle Pro](https://wiki.www.uprr.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=189113913) with tenting. Having a tilted keyboard is a more natural position for the hands, and the split keyboard prevent awkward wrist bending.
* I use a [handhouse mouse](https://handshoemouse.com/). This mouse encourages moving your arm and shoulder instead of your hands and wrists.
 
Do light stretching/exercises to warm up and prevent injury.  Desk work can take a toll on the body over time.
