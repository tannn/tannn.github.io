It could have beeen a laptop or computer keyboard or mouse. Either an ergonomic or horizontal mouse. I even tried a keyboard tray with an adjustable height. At some point, it doesn’t matter what the tool is: so long as it involves some variation of a physical keyboard and mouse, I would experience pain.

This problem started sometime after summer of 2018. During that summer I built my first gaming PC. By the time September rolled around, I was experiencing pain while playing games. But I soon learned it wasn’t just when playing games: it would come back even after using the computer for a few minutes. Typing essays and doing homework became even more painful. I switched to and from my PC and my MacBook to figure out if there was a setup that wouldn’t cause pain. Unfortunately, it’s been a year and a half since the pain started, and I have yet to find a solution.

Why has it taken so long? Well, the pain is inconsistent: some days are better than others. Then, last year I graduated and started working full time as a software engineer. Initially, the pain wasn’t too bad and mostly bearable or very easy to ignore, if it was present at all. But gradually the pain became worse, more consistent and harder to ignore. 

I had already seen two doctors about the pain and had an ERG study by this point. They didn’t think I had carpal tunnel or arthritis. The doctors expected ergonomics to be the main culprit. While I spent a few weeks trying to get an ergonomic study at work (we love beuacracy), I tried to reinforce basic ergonomic principles on myself: feet firmly on the ground, back straight, arms at a 90 degree angle. 

When I eventually saw the ergonomist, she recommended a new chair, keyboard, mouse, and raising my monitors. She also encouraged regular breaks throughout the day so I could let my hands rest for a few minutes. These adjustments held me over for a little bit, but the pain was still present at a lower level.
Then, in spring of 2021, my hands gave out. The pain became too much to bear and I could not get work done. I used short term disability leave and started to see an occupational hand therapist. At some points, the pain was so bad that using my phone was painful. Swiping on the screen or holding it for too long would become unbearable.
After a few months, I was able to manage the pain myself through breaks and stretching exercises. Today, I keep that up with stretching occasionally and routine breaks, along with a daily warmup for my hands before I start work on the computer.

# Hands
* Avoid resting hands on keyboard, lap, or wrist rest (this could compress the ulnar or median nerves)
* Avoid resting arms on arm rests (this can compress the ulnar nerve)
* Fingers/hands should float above keyboard while typing
* Wrists should be below elbows while typing (prevents nerve compression)
* Do not strain your hand across the keyboard when doing keyboard shortcuts (use your other hand)
* Take breaks (this means no phones): Motion is lotion, keep moving, don’t stay in one position for long - 10/20 min for blood to circulate; can try 1 min of full body movement; or go for a walk
* Use your arm/shoulder to move mouse, not your wrist. For this same reason, don’t use the trackpad on your laptop.
* Numbness/tingling: Usually a worse sign than pain. Do nerve glides/stretches. Consider seeing a doctor.
* Sleeping with arms folded (like hugging a teddy bear) can compress nerves. Beware of any tingling/numbness in hands from sleeping.
* When holding a phone in your hand, do not use your pinky to support it from the bottom (stresses ulnar nerve)

# Eyes
* 20/20/20: Look 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes to relax the muscles in your eyes

# Keyboards and Mouse
* Your mileage may vary, but I've had the best luck with the [Kinesis Freestyle Pro](https://wiki.www.uprr.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=189113913) with tenting. Having a tilted keyboard is a more natural position for the hands, and the split keyboard prevent awkward wrist bending.
* I use a [handhouse mouse](https://handshoemouse.com/). This mouse encourages moving your arm and shoulder instead of your hands and wrists.
 
Do light stretching/exercises to warm up and prevent injury.  Desk work can take a toll on the body over time.
